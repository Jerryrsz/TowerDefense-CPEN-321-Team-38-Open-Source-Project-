This game is a tower defence game.

The 5 shields at the top left are your lives, you lose when you hit 0. Every time a enemy crosses the finish line and goes offscreen, you lose 1 shield, with the exception of the boss, who takes 2 shields.

You place towers on the gray squares on the grid, by first clicking the tower button and then the sqaure you want. You can upgrade towers by selecting a tower and then clicking one of the upgrade buttons. You must have enough money in order to upgrade a tower.

You can right click to cancel placing a tower, and towers can have their upgrades switched for a small fee.

There are n number of waves per level and when all of the waves are defeated, you move on to the last level. When you finish the last level, you win. Enemies get tougher as the waves go on, and there are different types of enemies.

You can right click on an enemy to target them, which forces all towers to prioritize attacking them if possible and deal extra (10%) damage.

Advancing the next wave before the previous one is completely defeated is not recommended.

Thanks to the many people who helped playtest this.

Have fun!
